# BERT_NER_PyTorch_MLFlow

This is a BERT NER model using PyTorch adapted from Abhishek (https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/bert-entity-extraction). 
MLFlow is wrapped around the training.py to log training results locally. Script is set with CUDA enabled.
Model training parameters can be set in config.py, eg. Batch_size, and Epoch.

Understand the script by watching the Youtube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQ7rqRllIc&t=238s
